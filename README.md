## :technologist: About me

My name is Daniel Kulichkov, and I am a **Software Developer** at [First Line Outsourcing](https://www.flo.team/ru/).
Currently, my main focus is web development with cloud technologies such as AWS Serverless, using tools like Angular for frontend development.

I’m passionate about learning and rapidly acquiring new skills. Currently, I'm diving into Go and Rust to broaden my expertise.
I’ve worked on a variety of projects, including Hasha, a CLI tool designed to calculate file hashes faster than macOS' built-in solution.
I'm also actively developing Bakman, a backup CLI tool. You can explore my projects and more details below.

While I’m not currently involved in open-source contributions, I look forward to engaging with the community and contributing 
to meaningful projects in the future.
